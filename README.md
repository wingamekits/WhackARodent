##Description

The Whack-a-Rodent Starter Kit is a Construct 2 template for a simple arcade style game where you have to tap "rodents" or other objects as they pop up on the screen before they disappear. The game ends when the player misses a given number of the objects.

**Note: this template is optimized for Windows 8. Updates are planned to improve the experience for both Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8**
